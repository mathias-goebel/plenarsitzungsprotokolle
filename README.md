# Plenarsitzungsprotokolle
Archiving a processed version of debate protocols from the German Bundestag.

In the data dir currently the protocols from the 20th Bundestag are included. See â†“ for older ones.

## Archive
Completed periods are getting released here. So a *git tag* will point to the data and a release is stored for convenience.

### WP 19
For the 19. Bundestag all protocols are available via the [corresponding release](https://github.com/mathias-goebel/plenarsitzungsprotokolle/releases/tag/wp19).
In the data dir here, we start over with the 20. Bundestag.

## How it works
See [this corresponding repo](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/mgoebel/plenarsitzungen), where all the processing takes place.
